AUTOMATION-WITH-PYTHON PROJECT
I gonna write an application that will read a spreadsheet file from local  file system it will read some information from that spreadsheet file and do somebwork with that data and
this could be very useful 
usecase- if you working with lots of files and you want want to do some data processing in those file and you dont want to do that manually by automating or writting a program in python
that basically can do anything in a file or across multiple files 


# We are going to have an input file a spreadsheet file that we are going to be  working with and that spreadsheet will look like this it is called INVENTORY
INVENTORY FILE simulates something that many companies would have and employees of that company would be working with.
We read the information from this file and we are going to do something with that information 

-> We write logic that calculates how many products  we have per supplier and per supplier we are gonna calculate number of products from that specifiec company 
RESULT we are gonna list the company so all companies with their respective number of products 
-> THEN  another logic that lists inventory products that have inventory which is less than 10 so basically those ones

1)1st -LIST EACH COMPANY WITH RESPECTIVE PRODUCTCOUNT.

2)2ND- LIST PRODUCT WITH INVENTORY LESS THAN 10.

3)3RD- LIST EACH COMPANY WITH RESPECTIVE TOTAL INVENTORY VALUE.

4)4th - WRITE TO  SPREADSHEET: CALCULATE AND WRITE INVENTORY VALUE FOR EACH PRODUCT INTO SPREADSHEET
SO PRODUCT count times price and we are going to write that value to an addtional column in the spreadsheet 
and after  rhat we are going to save that updated spreadsheet file, programmatically using python

5)ATLAST A NEW FILE GOT GENERATED WITH THE NAME INVENTORY WITH TOTAL VALUES AND IF WE OPEN THIS FILE WE SHOULD SEE THAT FOR EACH ROW A NEW COLUMN GENERATED FILLED  WITH VALUES 

MAIN COMMAND USE- Built-in-module(pip install openpyxl) command 

USECASE-
THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY USEFUL AUTOMATION LOGIC WHEN YOU ARE WORKING AT A COMPANY THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCEL FILES OR SPREADSHEET FILES EMPLOYEES HAVE TO WORK WITH AND MANUUALLY UPDATE 
STUFF INSIDE.
